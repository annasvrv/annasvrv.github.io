					<h4 class="mt-3">Fun facts</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The edelweiss's scientific name is Leontopodium alpinum.
						</li>
						<li>
							The original home of the edelweiss is in the high plateau of the Himalayas and Siberia, but the plant "migrated" to Europe during the Quaternary ice ages.
						</li>
						<li>
							The edelweiss is a perennial, which means it will flower year after year but must reseed itself. Continuous picking of the flowers from the same plant will cause it to die off. In other words, look, but don't touch!
						</li>
						
						<li>
							The edelweiss is fertilized by flies.
						</li>
						<li>
							Despite its inconspicuous appearance it is esteemed (chiefly by the Swiss) as a symbol of purity and inaccessibility.
						</li>
						<li>
							In Switzerland the edelweiss is protected by law.
						</li>
						<li>
							During WWI and WWII Alpine soldiers carried a sprig of edelweiss to remind them of home. It was traditionally given to them by a female friend, or sister.
						</li>
						<li>
							The movie, The Sound of Music, almost caused the flower to become extinct because so many tourists were picking them. But It can no longer be regarded as an endangered species.
						</li>
						<li>
							At the 2015, Lady Gaga sang a melody of songs from The Sound of Music, including the iconic song, Edelweiss and killed it! (She didn't kill the flower, she killed the performance… you know what I mean)
						</li>
						<li>
							Towards the end of the Second World War, the Edelweiss became the symbol of the German resistance against Nazism. The “Edelweiss pirates” were groups of young workers who had turned against Nazism and were active as a kind of urban guerrillas against the regime.
						</li>
						<li>
							The edelweiss isn't really the prettiest flower in the world… It's probably one of the farthest from pretty! But that is why we love it. Because it has more charm, history and meaning behind it than out right beauty. (and it looks great illustrated! Or as a Clip!)

					<div class="m-3">
						The flower's common name Edelweiß is German, and is a compound of edel "noble" and weiß "white". Slovenian name is planika, meaning mountain girl. In Romania, it is known as floare de colț, which means 'cliffhanger's flower.' The flower is referred to as Stella Alpina in the Italian-speaking Alps and étoile des Alpes in the French Alps, meaning 'star of the Alps.'
					</div>
					<div class="m-3">
						Edelweiß was one of several regional names for the plant and achieved wide usage during the first half of the 19th century in the context of early Alpine tourism.[3] Alternative names include Chatzen-Talpen ("cat's paws") and the older Wullbluomen ("wool flower," attested in the 16th century).
					</div>
					<div class="m-3">
						The scientific name Leontopodium is a latinisation of the Greek leontopódion, "lion's paw". The Latin specific epithet nivale means "white".
